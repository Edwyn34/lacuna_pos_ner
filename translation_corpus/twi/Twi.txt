Why are we just splitting heads because medical laboratory scientists believe the laboratory space is for them. It is not for them,” Mr. Akosa insisted.
he added issues affecting the private sector, including shortcomings in the tax collection system and general misunderstanding of the tax laws in the business community, must be addressed by Parliament.
The meeting will seek to find an amicable solution to the stand-off over the posting of two hematologists to the laboratory service department of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital.
His comment comes as a response to the ongoing speculation by some Ghanaians insisting that aside military officials unjustly destroying excavators and other mining equipment of miners, pieces of gold chanced upon on the site are seized.
He thus described it as an “embarrassing stain” on the country’s judicial and electoral systems as well as a major source of worry to well-meaning Ghanaians.

Mr. Bless told the Daily Graphic in an interview that the projects were meant to facilitate teaching and learning in the school.
For example, some partners divorce simply because one partner feels that he or she “deserves better.
The entire Law Village Project, according to the President, will cost about US$55 million, with Phase One of the project complementing the facilities of the Accra Main Campus located at Makola, at a cost of US$4 million). “Once completed, the Law Village will boast of an additional seating capacity of one thousand five hundred (1,500) seats, a number of lecture halls, a well-resourced library, residential facilities, offices, amongst others,” he added.

BECAUSE they move without limbs, snakes need robust skin that can withstand constant friction.
Some species climb up rough tree trunks, while others burrow into abrasive sand.
What makes the skin of a snake so durable?
The skin of snakes can differ in thickness and structure from one species to another.
However, the skin of all snakes has one thing in common: It is firm on the outside and becomes progressively softer toward the inside.
Material that has a transition from a stiff outside to a flexible inside can distribute an impacting force over a larger area,” says researcher Marie-Christin Klein.
The unique structure of snake skin allows sufficient traction between body and ground for the snake to be able to move, and at the same time, it evenly distributes pressure from sharp-edged stones so that there is less damage to the skin.
Durability is vital, since snakes usually shed their skin only every two to three months.
Materials with the properties of snake skin may be useful in the field of medicine—for example, in manufacturing slip-resistant and extra-durable artificial implants.
Also, drive and conveyor machinery that mimics the construction of snake skin may require fewer pollutive lubricants.
THE greater wax moth can hear high-pitched sound better than any known creature in the world.
Yet its ears are very simple in structure, each being about the size of a pinhead.
For years, the greater wax moth’s hearing has been a subject of study.
More recently, scientists at the University of Strathclyde, Scotland, tested the moth’s hearing with a wide range of sounds.
Researchers would like to use the superior hearing capability of the greater wax moth as the basis for new technology.
Is technology your master or your servant?
Many would say that they control their devices, not the other way around.
But technology can affect people subtly in ways they do not realize​—even in ways they do not want.
Thanks to texting, email, videoconferencing, and social media, two people can communicate easily, even when they live continents apart.
For them, technology is a useful servant.
However, some people who primarily use technology to maintain friendships tend to show less empathy for their friends, feel more lonely and empty and  focus more on self than on others.
Empathy requires that we slow down and patiently consider another person​—something that may seem difficult to achieve with an overload of social media posts and rapid-fire texting.
In time, if technology is controlling you, responding to your friends’ messages can seem like another chore on your to-do list.
Your goal becomes to clear out your in-box rather than to help a friend in need.
One study found that many people felt worse after browsing through a popular social media platform.
The researchers concluded that looking at the pictures and updates of others can leave a person with “a feeling of not having done anything meaningful.
Furthermore, looking at the exciting photos others have posted can lead to negative comparisons.
After all, it may seem as if everyone else were having a good time, while your own life is in a rut.
One teacher notes that some of her students seem inclined toward one-sided friendships in which their greatest concern is, “Who has my back?”
Such friendships focus merely on what one gets out of the relationship.
A person could start to view his friends as apps that can be used and shut off as needed.
Does what you post online show that you may have the tendency to be competitive or to focus too much on yourself?​
When technology is your servant rather than your master, it will help you keep in touch with your friends and even draw closer to them.
Have more in-person conversations (rather than solely relying on texting or email)
Put away (or silence) the phone when conversing with others
Cut back on the time spent scrolling through social media

Do I have genuine friendships with people I care about and who care about me?
How often does a phone call, text, or notification interrupt an in-person conversation I am having with a friend?
Could the photos and comments that I post on social media give the impression that I am focusing on myself?
How do I feel after a period of browsing through social media?
What adjustments could I make so that my use of technology does not prevent me from making true friends?
Friendships take time and effort, so realistically you may only have a few. It’s not about numbers but about quality. True friends look out for your best interests, and you look out for theirs
Children are so proficient at using technology that they are commonly called “digital natives,” while adults who are less adept at using technology are referred to as “digital immigrants.”
At the same time, some have noted that young people who spend a lot of time online tend to  develop a dependency on their devices,  become involved in cyberbullying and be exposed to pornography, whether or not by choice.
Some online activities​—gaming, for example—​tend to be highly addictive. That is no accident.
The apps on our phones are designed to keep us at our phones
The longer we stare at commercial apps on our screens, the more profitable we become to advertisers.
Do your children seem overly attached to their devices? How can you help them make better use of their time?​
When online, some people become more aggressive, vulgar, and insensitive to others’ feelings​—traits that can lead to bullying.
Some misuses of social media can be related to a person’s inordinate desire to be liked or followed.
Or if a person finds out he was not included in some way​—for example, he sees he was not invited to a party—​this could make him feel as if he were being bullied.
Do your children use proper manners online?
The Internet has made lewd content easily available and accessible.
Parents should realize that while filters can help, they are not foolproof.
Sexting​—sending or receiving explicit personal images, usually via smartphone—​can have legal consequences. In some cases, depending on local laws and the ages of those involved, people who sext can be charged with spreading child pornography.
Do we use a digital device as a babysitter to keep our child occupied?
Does our child need a device with Internet access? If so, why?
Can we afford to give our child a device with Internet access?
How has our child already demonstrated self-control?
Why do your children want a phone? How do they use yours? What sites do they go to? What games do they play? How long do they use it? Test your children’s maturity and self-control before giving them a device.
When used properly, technology can strengthen the relationship between a husband and wife.
For example, it can help a couple stay in touch throughout the day.
However, some spouses allow misuse of technology to rob them of valuable time together, bring work into the home unnecessarily and create distrust and even disloyalty
Some people have to be available around the clock because of the nature of their secular work.
Others, whose jobs are not so demanding, still find it difficult to leave their job behind them at the end of the day.
It’s hard not to check every phone call or text message that I receive for work during time that I’ve set aside to spend with my wife
Do you give undivided attention to your spouse when he or she is speaking to you?
One poll found that suspicious use of social media was a common cause of marital fights.
Ten percent of those surveyed admitted posting material online that they keep hidden from their spouse.
For good reason, social media has been called a “marriage minefield” and even “an adultery service.
Not surprisingly, divorce lawyers say that social media plays a significant role in many of today’s marriage breakups.
Do you hide from your spouse communications with someone of the opposite sex?​
A person who neglects eating will not stay healthy. Similarly, a person who neglects spending time with his or her spouse will find it difficult to maintain a healthy marriage.​
I work from home, so I try to stop work at a set time. I also turn off email notifications after a certain hour so that I can use my phone for things like checking the time without being distracted by work
People are constantly learning​—whether for school, for work, or for other reasons.
Technology can help. Never in history has it been so easy to access so much information, without having to leave your home or even get up from your chair.
However, many who make extensive use of technology find that they, have difficulty concentrating while reading, have trouble focusing on one task at a time, become quickly bored in moments of solitude
Some browse and scan material instead of patiently following an author’s train of thought.
Skim-reading is fine when you need to find a quick answer to a question.
However, it can hinder comprehension when you need to consider a subject more deeply.
How well are you able to read long passages of text? How can doing so improve your learning?
Some people assume that technology gives them the ability to perform two tasks at a time​—for example, to text friends while studying.
But when their attention is divided, they may not perform either task well, especially when both require concentration.
Focus requires self-discipline, but it is well worth the effort. “You make fewer mistakes and have less stress,
I’ve learned that it’s better to concentrate on one thing at a time and avoid the distraction of multitasking.
Does multitasking interfere with your ability to comprehend and remember what you study?​
Some people become uneasy when they are alone in quiet surroundings, and they turn to technology to fill the void. “I get bored within 15 minutes if I don’t check my phone or tablet or turn on the TV
However, periods of solitude provide a valuable opportunity for deep thinking​—an essential part of learning, not only for young people but also for adults.
Are you able to use periods of solitude to your advantage?​
In what ways could you use technology to enhance your thinking skills? What uses could interfere with your ability to concentrate and learn?
Do I have trouble concentrating when reading a long section of text on a screen? If so, what most often is likely to distract me?
What steps can I take to reduce or even eliminate those distractions?
Start small by reading brief sections of text at first and then gradually increasing the amount. Read out loud, softly, to keep focused on the material.
What adjustments can I make so that I have adequate time to think and reflect on what I have read?
Use the last ten minutes of a study period to review what you have learned.
In what circumstances am I likely to try to multitask?
What adjustments could I make so that I focus on one task at a time?
Keep your study area clear of distractions so that you are not tempted to multitask.
Prejudice is like a virus. It harms its victims, and people can be unaware that they are infected.
People can be prejudiced not only toward those of another nationality, race, tribe, or language but also toward those of a different religion, gender, or social class.
Some judge people negatively based on their age, education, disabilities, or physical appearance.
Yet, they still feel that they are not prejudiced.
Could you be infected with prejudice? Most of us can recognize prejudice in others.
But it may be difficult to see prejudice in ourselves. The truth is that all of us are prejudiced to some degree.
Some employers have mistakenly believed that women are unqualified for scientific or technical jobs.
In medieval Europe, Jews were falsely accused of poisoning wells and spreading disease. During Nazi rule, Jews were again slandered. But this time they were accused of causing the economic crisis in Germany. Both cases resulted in the Jews becoming victims of extreme prejudice, some of which is still evident today.
Many people wrongly conclude that everyone who has a disability is sad or bitter.
People who believe myths such as those may point to examples or alleged evidence that seems to confirm their bias. And they think that anyone who disagrees with them is ignorant.
Without knowing the facts, we make bad decisions. If we believe myths rather than facts, we will misjudge people.
If we know the facts about people, we are less likely to believe common but false  assumptions about them.
And once we learn that we have not been told the truth about a particular group, we may be more likely to question assumptions that we have made about other groups of people.
Remember that sweeping generalizations about groups of people do not apply to all individuals of that group.
Acknowledge that the information you have about others may be limited.
Try to get the facts from a reliable source.
When we empathize with someone, we become aware of just how similar we are to that person.
We realize that he or she may feel the way we feel and may react the way we react.
Empathy helps us to see that all people, no matter what their background may be, are part of the human family.
The more we focus on how similar they are to us, the less likely we will be to judge them negatively.
Empathy will also help us to respect others. Anne-Marie, from Senegal, once looked down on people who came from so-called lower castes.
She explains how empathy helped her: “When I saw the hardships suffered by those who belonged to lower castes, I asked myself how I would feel in their position.
This moved me to question the validity of my supposed higher status​—one that I had neither chosen nor earned.
Yes, if we strive to understand another person’s struggles, we are more likely to empathize rather than to criticize.
In the past, I thought that deaf people were strange, intellectually impaired, and overly sensitive. So I avoided them. However, I did not think that my viewpoint was prejudiced, since it did not seem to harm anyone.
Feeling empathy for deaf people helped me to counteract the prejudice I had. For example, I had the impression that the deaf were intellectually handicapped because when I spoke to them, they would look at me blankly. So I tried to imagine how I would feel if I could not hear someone talking to me. Of course I would have a blank face! Even if I had a hearing aid, my facial expression might seem to indicate, ‘I am struggling to understand,’ when really I would be struggling to hear.
As I put myself in a deaf person’s shoes, my prejudices evaporated into thin air.
Egotism can lead to prejudice. An egotistical person has an inflated opinion of his own worth.
He views himself as superior and judges people who are different from him as being inferior.
To avoid excessive pride, we need to cultivate its opposite​—humility.
Humility allows us to recognize that in some areas of life others are superior.
No one group has a monopoly on all good qualities and abilities.
Try to have a realistic view of yourself and remain aware of your own failings.
Acknowledge that others are strong in areas where you are weak. Do not assume that all people from a particular group have the same flaws.
I spent most of my younger years in an area where the population was predominantly of one race and background. But when I moved to a large city at the age of 19 to work in a factory, I found myself working with and living near people of many different races, backgrounds, and cultures.
As I got to know my workmates and made friends, I saw firsthand that people’s skin color, mother tongue, and nationality told me absolutely nothing about how hard they worked, how trustworthy they were, or what their innermost feelings were.
I later married a woman whose home country and race were different from mine, and I have found much joy in learning about different kinds of foods and forms of music that were new to me. Life has taught me that all of us have faults and virtues. To be honest, I have become a better person as a result of admiring and imitating the virtues of people who are very different from me racially and culturally.
If we isolate ourselves from people whom we view negatively, we may reinforce our prejudices.
And if we limit our friends to people who are like us, we may tend to think that our way is the only acceptable way of thinking, feeling, and acting.
When we get to know others personally, we begin to understand why they do things differently. And as we grow closer to them, we start to see them as part of our own group. We come to value them more, and their joys and sorrows become our own.
Some people choose lifestyles with habits that are harmful to themselves and to others. Hence, we should be selective when expanding our circle of friends. It is not prejudicial to avoid friendship with unscrupulous individuals who behave in a depraved or offensive manner. While you should not seek to harm people who violate your moral standards or seek to deprive them of their rights, it is wise to exclude them from your circle of friends.​
If you try to understand how their experiences have shaped their personality, you may develop a positive attitude toward people from their group.
We grew up in South Africa during apartheid. People of different races were forced to live in separate communities, which fostered feelings of prejudice among the various racial groups.
We were not white, and we particularly disliked white people because some had treated us as inferiors.
At the time, we did not think that we were prejudiced. Rather, we felt that we were victims.
To change our attitude, we took the initiative to widen out and have friends from different backgrounds.
As we began to associate with white people, we realized that very little set us and them apart. We all experience similar circumstances and challenges.
We even took the opportunity to host a white couple as guests in our home for a long period of time.
We got to know them well. Soon we began to see each other as friends and equals.
As a result, we started to view white people in general more positively.”
Although they were of different races and political views, Johny and Gideon developed a close friendship.
Feelings of prejudice do not disappear quickly. Just as it takes time and effort to get rid of a virus, it takes time and effort to get rid of prejudice. What can you do to remove prejudice from within you?
Doing kind things for others brings people together. The more you show your love for others, the less prejudiced you become.
The more love you feel, the less room you leave in your heart for hatred or contempt.
Think of specific ways that you can show love for people who are from a group that you may have viewed negatively.
These actions do not have to be elaborate.
Show good manners to members of that group by holding the door open or by giving up your seat on public transportation for one of them.
Try to engage in small talk, even if they do not speak your language fluently.
Be patient when they act in a way that you do not understand.
Be sympathetic if they talk about their problems.
I once felt prejudice toward immigrants. I was told that many immigrants fraudulently lived off social benefits and that they were more prone to criminal behavior.
This made it difficult for me to accept them. However, I did not characterize my feelings as prejudice, because this was how the majority of people viewed immigrants.
In time, however, I realized that my negative attitude toward immigrants was in fact prejudicial.
At some point, everyone is affected by tragedy​—perhaps an illness, an accident, a natural disaster, or an act of violence.
Some attribute suffering to fate or in some other way feel that we have little control over what happens to us.
Others believe in karma. They say that we suffer because of something bad that we did earlier in life or in a past life.
Tragedy often leaves people with more questions than answers.
The fact that good people suffer goes against our sense of justice. It also suggests that there is little point in being good.
Some people believe that humans experience a cycle of death and rebirth.
They say that those who committed good deeds are reborn into favorable circumstances, whereas those who committed bad deeds are reborn into a life of hardship.
According to that belief, even a good person can suffer if he committed bad deeds in a “past life.
What purpose would such suffering serve, since the person supposedly reborn does not even recall his past life?
Why do we work hard to stay healthy and avoid accidents if our well-being is largely determined by what we did in a past life?
We hear a lot about what goes wrong in families that fail. But what goes right in those that succeed?
Between 1990 and 2015, the divorce rate in the United States doubled for those over the age of 50 and tripled for those over 65.
Parents are confused: Some experts recommend giving children constant praise, while others advocate tough love.
Young people are entering adulthood without the skills they need to succeed.
Marriage can be a rewarding and permanent bond.
Parents can learn to discipline their children with love.
